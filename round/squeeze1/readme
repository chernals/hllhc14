The optics file name is 

opt_{BETA15}_{BETA8}_{KQX2}_{SCX}.madx

where:

BETA15 is the pre-squeeze beta*
BETA8  is the beta* in point 8
KQX2 is the normalized gradient of the triplets in point 2 normalized in nominal gradient in %
SCX is the ATS scaling factor defined as final_beta*=BETA15*SCX/10000
